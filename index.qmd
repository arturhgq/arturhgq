Hey there! I am Artur Quirino; I do research and data analysis. Academically, I am interested in several topics, especially political parties, elections, accountability, regime change, methodology and programming. Currently, I am now researching accountability and learning Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Before, I've been researching democratic backsliding in my master’s thesis.  

Regarding data analysis, I often create functions in `R`. When I write several functions on the same topic, I make an effort to put them together in a `R` package, but this is not always the case. One of my 2023 challenges is to do the same thing using `Python`.  

In my spare time, I like to exercise. Sometimes I play games with my family, sometimes I do Jigsaw Puzzles.
