Hey! I'm Artur Quirino, I do research and data analysis. I am interested in several topics, especially political parties, elections, accountability, regime change, methodology and programming. I am currently researching democratic backsliding. I often create functions in `R` for data analysis as well. When I write several functions on the same topic, I make an effort to put them together in a `R` package, but this is not always the case. In my spare time, I like to exercise.
