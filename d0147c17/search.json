    "text": "Hey! Iâ€™m Artur Quirino, I do research and data analysis. I am interested in several topics, especially political parties, elections, accountability, regime change, methodology and programming. I am currently working with electoral polls and researching democratic backsliding. I often create functions in R for data analysis as well. When I write several of them on the same topic, I make an effort to put them together in a R package, but this is not always the case. In my spare time, I like to exercise."
